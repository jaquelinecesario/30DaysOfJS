## Booleans

A boolean data type represents one of the two values:true or false. Any comparisons return a boolean value which is either true or false.

### Truthy values

- All numbers(positive and negative) are truthy except zero
- All strings are truthy except an empty string ('')
- The boolean true

### Falsy values

- 0
- 0n
- null
- undefined
- NaN
- the boolean false
- '', "", ``, empty string

## Undefined

If we declare a variable and if we do not assign a value, the value will be undefined. In addition to this, if a function is not returning the value, it will be undefined.

`let firstName`

## Null

`let empty = null`

## Operators

### Assignment operators

- **=** - (x = y) - x is stored in x
- **+=** - (x += y) - x + y result is stored in x
- **-=** - (x -= y) - x - y result is stored in x
- ***=** - (x *= y) - x * y result is stored in x
- **/=** - (x / y) - x / y result is stored in x
- ****=** - (x **= y) - x ** y result is stored in x

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are mathematical operators.

- **Addition(+)**: a + b
- **Subtraction(-)**: a - b
- **Multiplication(*)**: a * b
- **Division(/)**: a / b
- **Modulus(%)**: a % b
- **Exponential(**)**: a ** b

### Comparison Operators

In programming we compare values, we use comparison operators to compare two values.

- **==** - **Equal** in value only: Equivalent (x == y)
- **===** - **Equal** in value and data type: Exactly equal (x === y)
- **!=** - **Not equal** in value only: Not equivalent (x != y)
- **!==** - **Not equal** in value and data type: Not exactly equal (x !== y)
- **>** - **Greater than** (x > y)
- **<** - **Less than** (x < y)
- **>=** - **Greater than or equal to** (x >= y)
- **<=** - **Less than or equal to** (x <= y)

### Logical Operators

The common logical operators:

- **&&(ampersand)** - The && operator gets true only if the two operands are true.
- **||(pipe)** - The || operator gets true either of the operand is true.
- **!(negation)** - The ! operator negates true to false and false to true.

### Increment Operator

In JavaScript we use the increment operator to increase a value stored in a variable. The increment could be pre or post increment.

1. Pre-increment

```js
let count = 0
console.log(++count)        // 1
console.log(count)          // 1
```

2. Post-increment

```js
let count = 0
console.log(count++)        // 0
console.log(count)          // 1
```

We use most of the time post-increment.

### Decrement Operator

In JavaScript we use the decrement operator to decrease a value stored in a variable. The decrement could be pre or post decrement.

1. Pre-decrement

```js
let count = 0
console.log(--count) // -1
console.log(count)  // -1
```

2. Post-decrement

```js
let count = 0
console.log(count--) // 0
console.log(count)   // -1
```

### Ternary Operators

Ternary operator allows to write a condition. Another way to write conditionals is using ternary operators. 

```js
let isRaining = true
isRaining
  ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
  : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
isRaining = false

isRaining
  ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
  : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
```

### Operator Precedence

Operators with higher precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence.

Within operators of the same precedence, the language groups them by associativity. Left-associativity (left-to-right) means that it is interpreted as (a OP1 b) OP2 c, while right-associativity (right-to-left) means it is interpreted as a OP1 (b OP2 c). 

Operators are first grouped by precedence, and then, for adjacent operators that have the same precedence, by associativity.

Where OP1 is a prefix unary operator and OP2 is a binary operator. If OP1 has higher precedence than OP2, then it would be grouped as (OP1 a) OP2 b; otherwise, it would be OP1 (a OP2 b).

If the unary operator is on the second operan,then the binary operator OP2 must have lower precedence than the unary operator OP1 for it to be grouped as a OP2 (OP1 b). 

Precedence Order:

1. Grouping - (...)
2. Five:
   1. Member Access -> ... . ...

## Window Methods

### Window alert() method

Window alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button. It is a builtin method and it takes on argument.

`alert(message)`

Do not use too much alert because it is destructing and annoying, use it just to test.

### Window prompt() method

The window prompt methods display a prompt box with an input on your browser to take input values and the input data can be stored in a variable. The prompt() method takes two arguments. The second argument is optional.

`prompt('required text', 'optional text')`

### Window confirm() method

The confirm() method displays a dialog box with a specified message, along with an OK and a Cancel button. A confirm box is often used to ask permission from a user to execute something. Window confirm() takes a string as an argument. Clicking the OK yields true value, whereas clicking the Cancel button yields false value.

`confirm('text')`

## Date Object

The object we create using Date object provides many methods to work with date and time.The methods we use to get date and time information from a date object values are started with a word get because it provide the information. 
getFullYear() - Get the **year** as a four digit number (yyyy)
getMonth() - Get the **month** as a number (0-11)
getDate() - Get the **day** as a number (1-31)
getHours() - Get the **hours** (0-23)
getMinutes - Get the **minute** (0-59)
getSeconds() - Get the **second** (0-59)
getMilliseconds() - Get the **milisecond** (0-999)
getTime() - Get the **time** (milliseconds since January 1, 1970)
getDay - Get the **weekday** as a number (0-6)

### Creating a time object

Once we create time object. The time object will provide information about time.

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now) // Sat Jan 04 2020 00:56:41 GMT+0200 (Eastern European Standard Time)
```

### Getting full year

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getFullYear()) // 2020
```

### Getting month

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getMonth()) // 0, because the month is January,  month(0-11)
```

### Getting date

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getDate()) // 4, because the day of the month is 4th,  day(1-31)
```

### Getting day

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getDay()) // 6, because the day is Saturday which is the 7th day
//  Sunday is 0, Monday is 1 and Saturday is 6
// Getting the weekday as a number (0-6)
```

### Getting hours

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getHours()) // 0, because the time is 00:56:41
```

### Getting minutes

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getMinutes()) // 56, because the time is 00:56:41
```

### Getting seconds

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getSeconds()) // 41, because the time is 00:56:41
```

### Getting time

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getTime()) // 1578092201341, this is the number of seconds passed from January 1, 1970 to January 4, 2020 00:56:41
```

- Using Date.now()
```js
const allSeconds = Date.now() //
console.log(allSeconds) // 1578092201341, this is the number of seconds passed from January 1, 1970 to January 4, 2020 00:56:41

const timeInSeconds = new Date().getTime()
console.log(allSeconds == timeInSeconds) // true
```

Let us format these values to a human readable time format. Example:

```js
const now = new Date()
const year = now.getFullYear() // return year
const month = now.getMonth() + 1 // return month(0 - 11)
const date = now.getDate() // return date (1 - 31)
const hours = now.getHours() // return number (0 - 23)
const minutes = now.getMinutes() // return number (0 -59)

console.log(`${date}/${month}/${year} ${hours}:${minutes}`) // 4/1/2020 0:56
```
